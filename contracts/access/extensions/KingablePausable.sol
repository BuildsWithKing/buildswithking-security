 * @notice Created on the 23rd of Sept, 2025.

 *         This contract sets the king at deployment (Initial king can be an EOA or a contract address),
 *            restricts access to some functions with the modifier "onlyKing".
 *         Allows kingship transfer and renouncement, pausing and activating the contract via the "whenActive" modifier.
 *
 *   @dev Abstract contract, to be inherited by contracts that require king-based and activation-based access control.
