# 🔐 BuildsWithKing-Security

A lightweight Solidity security utilities library.  
This repository contains reusable, security-focused smart contract modules that you can easily import into your Solidity projects, similar to OpenZeppelin’s approach.

## Features
- Reentrancy protection (NonReentrant)
- Ownership and access control utilities (coming soon)
- Gas-optimized security patterns for modern Solidity. 

## Installation

You can import the contracts directly from GitHub in your Solidity files:


Example: Importing the Reentrancy Guard

```solidity
import "https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/main/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```

> 💡 Note: Always verify the contract code and the specific commit hash before using in production.
For maximum safety, pin to a commit hash instead of main, like this:

```
import "https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/<commit-hash>/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```


You can also install this package into your Foundry/Hardhat project by adding it as a Git submodule or using forge install:

```bash
forge install BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security
```

Then import any module like:

```
import "buildswithking-security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! If you’d like to add new security modules or improve existing ones, feel free to fork the repo and submit a PR.

> All PRs will be reviewed for security and code quality before merging.
